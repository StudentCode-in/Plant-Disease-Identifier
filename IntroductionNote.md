#Plant_Disease_Identifier_Model
In order to move towards the Project we have to identify the problem and find the relevant dataset.
I want to say to the project contributing people first go through all classifier algorithms and list them in the repository which seams to be feasible for our project.
And with each algorithm come up with a relevant dataset also.
After this we can have a discussion on this.
